# Fun Trophy
The Fun Trophy is an event that occurs every year beginning of july in Belgium at Farni√®res.
During this event, teams are competiting to win the race.
The race is a serie of tracks that each team need to do as fast as possible. 
At the menu: running, climbing, swimming,... in the wood or in the mud, different activities like archery,...

## How does it work?
Each year, we have a new race. To facilitate the timing process, the teams are split between colors.
Each color has the same track order. 
To begin, the team need to go to the referee of its color to know the next track where it needs to go. When the track is ended, the team comes back to the referee to stop the timing and start the next track.
At the end of the race, we add bonuses according to the results of the activities.
